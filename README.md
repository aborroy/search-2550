# Deployment for Sizing Guide Data Generator process using ACS 7 and Elasticsearch

This project describes the process to generate volumes of random documents with associated metadata (in local filesystem or S3 Bucket) and the bulk ingestion of this content into an ACS 7 deployment using Elasticsearch as Search Service.

The tools used in the process are provided by the Performance Team and are also used as base for the Sizing Guide.

Following projects are required:

* Generation of documents and metadata in local environment (file system or S3): [https://github.com/Alfresco/sizing-guide-data-generator](https://github.com/Alfresco/sizing-guide-data-generator)
* Alfresco Repository Web Script API to ingest documents generated by the Data Generator project: [https://gitlab.alfresco.com/performance-benchmarking-framework/bulk-object-mapper/tree/master](https://gitlab.alfresco.com/performance-benchmarking-framework/bulk-object-mapper/tree/master)

Additionally an ACS Deployment (Docker Compose for this use case) is required.
